URL shortener should take long URL and create a short URL that is easy to remember and share

Upon entering short URL, the user should be redirected to long URL

Short URL should expire after some time (user can specify)

User can specify a custom short URL, too

User can delete their short URL before it expires

URL shortener doesn't need to have a UI, API will do just fine :)
